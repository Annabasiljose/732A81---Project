Where was God when I needed a friend? And where was God when I finished? Where was God when I lost my mind? Where was God when I could find? I don't want to be standing or down Don't want to be standing or down Don't want to be standing or down I don't want to be standing or down Where was love when I felt like hatred? Where was hatred when I felt like love? Where were you when you said you would be there? Where was fear when I said I was afraid? I don't want to be standing or down Don't want to be standing or down Don't want to be standing or down I don't want to be standing or down I don't want to be standing or down Tell me what you think I'm going to tell you what you should see Because I don't know who to trust My heart is filled with disgust I can't take this! No Tell me what you think I'm going to tell you what you need to see because I don't know who to trust me,3
"I'm going home, I'm going to load my rifle Wait by the door and turn on a cigarette If he's going to beat me now, he hasn't seen a fool yet He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll Don't sound like a real man I'm going to show him what a little girl does with Gunpowder and leads It's ten and a half hours, another pack of six in And I can feel the rumbling like a cold black wind He pulls in the car, the gravel flies He doesn't know what's waiting here this time I'm going to go home, I'm going to load my rifle Wait at the door and light a cigarette If he wants to fight now he has one and he doesn't see me crazy yet He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll Don't seem like a real man I'm going to show him what a little girl does with Gunpowder and lead His fist is bigger He's going to find me like a real doll",3
"From the dark of the deceiving lies A new star is born now it will put you in the light With its raging hands They have tried so hard to follow, but no one has cared inside you are all so hollow, you understand, nothing you can say (say), nothing will change what you've done to me Now it's time to shine (shin), I'm going to take what is mine while you're burning inside my light that I've given and you're taking and I've waited for you but I've made a mistake It's clear that you're afraid is so close to me Because I see the look on your face You've tried to hold my breath under, I've held my breath Alone and now you're wondering, What I'm asking Hey, nothing you can say (say), nothing will change what you've done to me Now it's time to shine (shin), you're going to burn in my light, nothing you can take, nothing will change what you've done to me (say) Now, I'm going to do what you're going to do what you're going to do what you're going to do that you're going to do",3
"Do you feel like you're going to be what you're going to be? Babe, you better know and you have a better plan all day Best plan all week, best plan all month Best plan all year You're dressed like a clown Putting your number This is the only time all year You'll never admit that I can see your eyes, I can see your brain Baby, nothing has changed I can see your eyes, I can see your brain Baby, nothing has changed Because you're hiding in a mask You're taking your shoot seriously, don't blow this year's luck Tomorrow your mold comes back after Halloween After Halloween You're going to work today You're going to work tomorrow Shim tonight You'll brag for months You remember what I've done, remember what I was back on Halloween? But what's between your ideas?",3
"An unanticipated future nestled somewhere in time Unsuspected victims No warning No judgment Day of the second coming Before seeing the light, you must die Forgotten children confirm a new faith Greed and lust controlled by hatred The endless search for your broken health The souls of the damnation in their own reality Chaos crawling in the age of distrust Impulsive habitat Confrontations Bastard sons generate your singing daughters Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity Supported by the immoral observance a dominant god Chaos crawling in an era of distrust Impulsive sabbatical confrontations On and south of the sky On and south of the sky On and south of the sky All evil is the heart of a black soul The force that lived all eternity The endless search for a truth never told The loss of all hope and your dignity Chaos crawling in an era of distrust On and south of the sky All evil is the heart of a black soul On and south of the sky On and south of the sky On and on the sky",3
"When I take you into the light I can see through this hole inside You listen rock and roll Believe in other gods If I think about it Baby We totally disagree When you're close to me Something moves in me Oh, the beast is free But I know you'll never be free Why am I always in pursuit of those running Why am I always in pursuit of those running It's a friend of mine We eat from time to time We drink and smoke and then I take a house with six trains I need time to pretend that he didn't touch me at all",3

"You can't sleep, you're a little obsessed with falling too deep and malfunctioning, you're a virus that intends to fuck something You're a crater on the face of a much bigger problem It's violence, or the lack of control Body and soul, digging a hole Is the stainless blood? Enjoy the pain by accepting your grief Are you finished? Do you not fall asleep, do not fall asleep Resurrection of the intention Once your vision is now produced in mass, Imagine the insults of art imagine accepting the truth Imagine accepting the truth Imagine accepting the truth Imagine accepting the truth Imagine accepting the truth The oscillating Hypnosis has taken control, now you hang on the shadow of a doubt Have you really thought about what you're all the name Now don't trust your instincts Just open the room where you keep these darkest regrets Imagine the things you've done wrong Rebellious to your leader a voice?",3

"The world of revenge-Judas Priest Hey listens don't let you give yourself the mind Fill your brain with orders and it's not just They play a game that approaches you Until you live in a world that is ruled by fear Always tease baby who is o.k. What they are givins maybe it's out of phase with me You once said you'll never win the race Even old not tomorrow thrown into the face We shout for revenge The world is a manic place screaming, screaming for revenge The world is defiled in shame Tie a blindfold all around your head Turn into torture before the dread And then you're pushed and pushed into all corners And they take you into the final slaughter As the sweat runs over your neck All your time praying to stop breaking your body And your heart will soon explode",3

"Shake your head like it's wrong Before you're here, you're already gone And even with the light all around you You're all alone in the dark. You break your own heart Too far on the lonely road You say there's only one love But when it's close enough you let go The very thing that you've been most afraid of You've done it from the beginning, you break your own heart.

You break your own heart You're doing it too far on the lonely road You say it's just a love But when it's close enough you let go The very thing that you've been most afraid of You've done it from the beginning, you break your own heart. You're breaking your own heart. You don't say it's too late, I'm still here. If only you let your fears go.",3

"When you ruminate the desperate ends of time. Have you wandered in your lost and resigned days? Or recreate the universes in your mind? Everyone is a bastard The world is, like plaster. And the momentary pleasures take their turn, As the ingenious boy exhausts of things to learn. The episodes of yours will never come back. Fear a little hope, You will need this just to face, You are the decision, the numbers do not count. When you bite the dust, Is not the goal of all confidence, You will never relive it, Think before you die. Think, think, think before you die. Deficit and depravity, In the wake of despair. We write morals correct the nation, Now may be a time. As you ruminate the desperate ends of time, You wonder how your life has been defined?",3
